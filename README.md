# TopUpWebApp
## Project Overview

This project consists of two APIs, `TopUp.API` and `UserBalance.API`, developed using .NET 8. 

`TopUp.API` is responsible for handling top-up transactions, while `UserBalance.API` manages user balance information. 

## Prerequisites

- .NET 8 SDK
- A suitable IDE such as Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the root directory of the project in your terminal.
3. To run the `TopUp.API`, navigate to the `TopUp.API` directory and run the following command:
```
 dotnet run
```
5. To run the `UserBalance.API`, navigate to the `UserBalance.API` directory and run the following command:

Please note that both APIs need to be running simultaneously for the solution to work as expected.
